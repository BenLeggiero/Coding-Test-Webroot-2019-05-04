# Coding Test - Webroot - 2019-05-04

Ben Leggiero's coding test for Webroot, done 2019-05-04. 


## Screen recordings of the coding process ##

These are forthcoming.


## To test functionality ##

Although this is largely to show of code quality, you should probably also wish to test the running code.

To aid this, the mock database powering the sample app is pre-populated with two sample users:

1. Jane Doe (username `JaneDoe`; Password `A password which is seemingly very strong`)
2. That Guy (username: `jimmy`; Password `password1`)

You may also register your own user. However, as of this time there is no way to then use that user to test signing in, as the mock database is all in process-space memory, and there is no sign-out button.


If you don't have access to Xcode to build the framework and test app, you may run [the pre-built app](https://github.com/BenLeggiero/Coding-Test-Webroot-2019-05-04/releases) attached to [the GitHub mirror of this repository](https://github.com/BenLeggiero/Coding-Test-Webroot-2019-05-04).
